#IDEA:
#we'll have the deploy script pull from a 'staging' branch
#and have the live site pull from the master branch

#DANGER AREAS
#Static Files usually need special configuration on the webserver
#Database permission and path issues
#Dependencies

#SOLUTIONS
#use a staging site that uses identical infrastructure as your live site
#run functional tests against your staging site
#run site on a virtual env
#automate deployment

#CLONING IN OUR GIT REPO
#save your github url for your superlists repo in your group_vars

#PLAYBOOK PLAN
#*we should run this script against our staging site first
# then, after we have it working, we should run a similar script.
# the only difference should be that we clone the staging repo to the
# live repo - not from our git repo - that way we are sure that whatever we got
# working is what is deployed to our live server - no matter what stupidy happens
# in our repo
#
# create a handler to chown errthang in sites to be owned by deploy
#run 'first 5 first'

#1. GET LATEST APP SOURCE
#	git fetch/clone from source repo
#

#2. CREATE OR UPDATE .ENV
#	ensure a venv exists
#	run bin/pip install -r requirements.txt

#3. UPDATE VIRTUALENV
#	*Harry's script adds stuff to .env with append()
#	I'd rather use my version of creating a .env file
#	with ansible

#4. UPDATE STATIC FILES
#	manage.py collectstatic --noinput


#5. UPDATE DATABASES
#	manage.py migrate --noinput
