we need to pay DO
log into DO
we need to add our server's private key to GH's list
	we need to create a ssh key on our server


- Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST
- Refactor away some duplication in urls.py

*our multi user FT is posting as soon as its loaded and fails early figure out why

*re_path(r'lists/(.+)/$', views.view_list, name='view_list'),
	              ^ This capture group magically ends up as an arguemnet
				    for whatever view it points to. Neat!

* as soon as your test goes green:
	- clean up the tested code as much as you can
	- if your test method has changed to test something new and different,
	  put it in a new and different testcase class
	  *Do the same for both UT's and FT's

Shipping:
after you go through the TDD loop enough and your project is at the point where
'someone' could use it, its time to put it online

- fire up a VM somewhere
- your playbook will contain all the things that need to be done server side.
  Review and revise the playbook often to ensure the site remains safe and reliable

- you can run a test server on 8000 like this:
  ./virtualenv/bin/python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000
  the site this now online with only a wimpy test server

* Not sure when static was supposed to be ignored, but now it's showing up server side.
  we'll have to go back and find out how and when it should have been ignored

* pain points
  - networking
  - ports
  - static files
  - database
