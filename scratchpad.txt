- Add URLs for adding a new item to an existing list via POST
- Refactor away some duplication in urls.py

*our multi user FT is posting as soon as its loaded and fails early figure out why

*re_path(r'lists/(.+)/$', views.view_list, name='view_list'),
	          ^ This capture group magically ends up as an arguemnet for whatever view it points to. Neat!

* as soon as your test goes green:
	- clean up the tested code as much as you can
	- if your test method has changed to test something new and different,
	  put it in a new and different testcase class
	  *Do the same for both UT's and FT's
